        <div class="panel">
          <p>Botson is IET MPSTME on Campus’ flagship event, a bot making workshop that is presently in its seventh
            edition this year. Participants in this workshop learn how to make an obstacle detecting, Bluetooth
            controlled bot from scratch from industrial experts and the Technical team of IET MPSTME. </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What kind of bot will I be building?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>It is a 4 wheeler robot with Bluetooth control and obstacle detection features.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Is BOTSON an online or offline event?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Botson is now fully conducted offline again! The event was conducted online for two years in the pandemic,

        <button class="accordion">What is the event duration?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>The event is conducted over two to three days, depending on the time allotted and the instructors. On the
            first day, the programming aspects and part testing phases are discussed, and the main bot is built on the
            second and third day over about six hours, inclusive of breaks, bot assembly and explanations.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Will there be any breaks during the event?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Yes. There will be regular breaks during the event.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Who is going to teach how to make the bot?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>There are trained instructors and technical experts who conduct the event and ensure that every participant
            returns home with a fully-functioning obstacle detecting bot.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Do I need to know coding to participate in BOTSON?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>No. The necessary basics will be taught on the first day of the event.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">How much is the registration fee for BOTSON?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>As per the current prices of all the equipment you shall be needing to successfully build the bot, the
            registration fees is Rs 3,000 for the whole kit, accounting for all parts necessary to build the bot, and
            spares for most parts used to guarantee that if any part is not functioning, a backup is readily available.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">How are we going to make the bot?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A kit is distributed by the IET team, containing all the necessary parts needed to build the bot in the
            beginning of the event. Post learning the theory, the instructors guide all participants through
            demonstrations and assistance in each step in creating the bot and ensuring optimum functioning of the bot
            before the event’s conclusion.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Will we learn about the parts which are being used in making the circuit?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Yes. The theory of each part will be taught on the first day of the event. Moreover, a comprehensive study
            guide will be provided to ensure all the assistance needed is available on hand, and the bot can be modified
            as per requirement in the future as well. </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What are the prerequisites needed to participate in BOTSON?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>There are presently no pre-requisites needed for BOTSON, as all basics are taught in the event,
            step-by-step to ensure no one is left behind. </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What is the kit exactly?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Kits are essentially boxes filled with equipment specially customised by IET. External equipment is not
            acceptable for this particular project and event as the kits are specially customised by IET for this
            particular workshop. The kit will contain all necessary parts and even spares for certain essential items in
            case of emergencies involving mishandling or even manufacturing defects.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What if the parts in the kit are defective when we receive the kit?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>All parts will be checked thoroughly before distribution. There are only two parts in the kit with a chance
            of being defective: the Bluetooth module and the motor driver. There will be an extra set of those parts
            inside the kit. Spares will be given for LEDs and wires.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What if I accidentally break a part in the kit?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Spares will be given for LEDs and wires. There will also be an extra Bluetooth module and motor driver. The
            more expensive parts will not have a spare.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">If I face any difficulty while making the bot, how will I be guided?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A team of technical instructors will conduct the event and remain on standby while training to assist with
            any queries or difficulties if you face any. </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Will the bot be functional after making it?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>There won't be any fun if it's not working. So YES! It will be fully functional and the knowledge you get
            will be useful after making it.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Will we get a certificate from IET?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Yes. A certificate of BOTSON will be issued post the event. </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What are the advantages of participating in Botson?</button>

            certificate of participation awarded by Microsoft Learn in collaboration with the London-based Institution
            of Engineering and Technology in a prestigious event such as this adds considerable weight to your
            CV/resume. Can be reprogrammed and repurposed for further use/projects in later years. Adds experience of
            bot development and programming</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">How do I register for Botson?</button>
